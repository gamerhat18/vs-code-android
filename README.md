### Simple and easy way to use VS Code Server on a phone without root.

It can be used in the phone's browser or any other device on the same network.  

### Pre-Requisites

 - A phone [_for iPhone, [see this](https://github.com/ish-app/ish)_]
 - Terminal emulator like Termux from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)
 - A network connection (VPN might cause problems when accessing via another device on the network)
 - Common Sense (optional)

### Step 1: Open Termux and paste this line

```bash
curl -fsSL https://git.io/JYLt6 | bash
```
